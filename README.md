# Deep Learning web inference engine in Rust

This project is a showcase of `Deep leaarning` inference engine implemented as fullstack Rust web applications.

The Deep learning frameworks used by this application are `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`.

Both frameworks are already ported to `rust` from native `C/C++` library. The purpose of this project is to build powerful fullstack webb application that has `Deep Learning` capabilities. By leveraging `rust` high performance web backend, the inference engine is way better than `python` in term of performance and easy integration with frontend compared to `C++`.

Features :

- Object detection : This feature uses `PyTorch` pretrained model generated by `TorchScript`
- Face detection : This features use `TensorFlow` pretrained `mtcnn` model.

# Object detection

This feature is a simple `computer vision` image classification. Uploaded image will be feeded into `PyTorch` pretrained model via `REST` API. The backend will response the object detection results in a JSON format. Then, the `front end` web displays it into the page. The result labels are displayed as list of `chips` components between title and `uploaded image`.

# Getting Started with Create Rust App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Rust App](https://github.com/wulf/create-rust-app).

## Requirements

- [stable Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Diesel CLI 
  - if using postgres, `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres`
  - if using sqlite, `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite-bundled`
- cargo-watch to recompile on change:
  - `cargo install cargo-watch` (allows running `cargo watch -x run -i frontend/` for continuous compilation; see "available scripts")

## Notes

- In development, the `.env` file is read (use `.env.example` for reference)
- In production, environment variables are sourced directly

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cargo fullstack`

Runs the app in development mode and watches for changes. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

Any frontend changes should instantly appear. Backend changes will need to recompile.
Needs `cargo-watch` installed, see requirements.

To test/debug issues with the production build, set the `debug-assertions` to `true` for `[profile.dev]` in `Cargo.toml`. This way, development-only code paths are discarded and instead, production-only code paths are included.

Alternatively, use `cargo run` to run the app in development mode without watching for file changes.

### `cargo build`

Builds a production-ready build.

### `cargo tsync`

Generates the typescript types from rust code marked with [`tsync`](https://github.com/Wulf/tsync).
Outputs to `frontend/src/types/rust.d.ts`.

### Running frontend and backend individually

```sh
# frontend
cd frontend && yarn && yarn start
```

```sh
# backend
cargo watch -x run -i frontend/
```

## Database Migrations

- `diesel migration generate <migration_name>`
- `diesel migration run`
- `diesel migration revert`

- `diesel database setup`
- `diesel database reset`


# Containerize your application
      
## Building a container
`docker build -t image-name .`

## Running the container
`docker run -e SECRET_KEY=123 -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/database -p 3000:3000 image-name`
